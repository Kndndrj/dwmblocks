# Andrej's dwmblocks

Status bar for dwm, similar to i3blocks, it uses simple scripts for displaying information on the status bar

## Adding or modifying blocks

Blocks are just scripts, to run them, add their path to the ```config.h``` file.

If the default configuration doesn't work, fix the paths in the above mentioned file.
